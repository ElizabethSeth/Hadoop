# Hadoop
What is Hadoop?
Hadoop is an open-source framework for processing and storing large datasets across distributed computer clusters. It is designed to handle big data efficiently.

Main Components of Hadoop:

HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System): A distributed storage system that splits large files into smaller blocks and distributes them across multiple machines.
MapReduce: A programming model for parallel processing of large data sets.
YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator): Manages resources and job scheduling in a Hadoop cluster.
HBase: A NoSQL database that provides real-time read/write access to big data.
Why Use Hadoop?

Scalability: Can handle petabytes of data across thousands of nodes.
Fault Tolerance: If a node fails, data is replicated to prevent loss.
Cost-Effective: Uses commodity hardware to store and process data.
Flexibility: Supports structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
Hadoop Ecosystem:

Apache Hive: Data warehouse system for querying and analyzing data with SQL-like syntax.
Apache Pig: A scripting language for processing large datasets.
Apache Spark: A faster alternative to MapReduce for in-memory big data processing.
Apache Flume & Apache Kafka: Tools for real-time data ingestion.
Use Cases:

Data Warehousing and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
Real-time Analytics and Machine Learning
Fraud Detection and Risk Management
Social Media and Log Data Analysis
