Hadoop MapReduce is a programming model for processing large datasets. 
Data processing includes words, numbers, and more structured or unstructured text.
MapReduce splits tasks into two steps: Map and Reduce.
Map works on words and emits key-value pairs.
Reduce aggregates the pairs to produce results.
